# Substitute

## Overview

A substitution cipher allowing you to specify bytes to replace with other byte values. This can be used to create Caesar ciphers but is more powerful as any byte value can be substituted, not just letters, and the substitution values need not be in order.<br><br>Enter the bytes you want to replace in the Plaintext field and the bytes to replace them with in the Ciphertext field.<br><br>Non-printable bytes can be specified using string escape notation. For example, a line feed character can be written as either <code>\n</code> or <code>\x0a</code>.<br><br>Byte ranges can be specified using a hyphen. For example, the sequence <code>0123456789</code> can be written as <code>0-9</code>.<br><br>Note that blackslash characters are used to escape special characters, so will need to be escaped themselves if you want to use them on their own (e.g.<code>\\</code>).

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | Available |
| Input requirement | `Required` |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Plaintext | `String` | no | `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` | — | no | The bytes you want to replace |
| 2 | Ciphertext | `String` | no | `XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW` | — | no | The bytes to replace them with |
| 3 | Ignore case | `Boolean` | no | `false` | — | no | If true, the case of the input character is preserved. |

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/substitute.rs` and declares `String` input and `String` output. The operation module owns conversion and domain-error rules; registry resolution, argument validation, input-requirement enforcement, tracing, and output validation are performed by `rxchef::execution`.

## Command-line use

This operation requires input. Supply literal UTF-8 with `--input`, exact bytes with `--input-file`, or pipe bytes on stdin.

```console
rxchef run "Substitute" --input-file input.bin --output-file output.bin
```

Arguments may be supplied positionally in the table order or by name with repeatable `--arg NAME=VALUE`. Omitted optional arguments use the documented defaults.

## Pipeline use

Place the operation anywhere a `String` value is valid. Its `String` result becomes the next step's input. Compact syntax uses the operation name followed by comma-separated arguments; JSON/YAML recipes use an `op` field and an `args` array.

## Error conditions

Schema violations are rejected before the operation runs. Malformed input, unsupported parameter combinations, unavailable optional backends, and domain processing failures produce structured errors and a non-zero CLI status; partial output is never reported as success.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` records an unassessed compatibility claim; it does not imply equality or incompatibility.

## Security considerations

Declared side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and apply execution limits to large data. Arguments marked sensitive in the schema are redacted from metadata-aware History displays.

## Testing evidence

Correctness tests:
- tests/tests/operations/substitute.rs

## Performance classification

Excluded from the committed representative benchmark set: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.
