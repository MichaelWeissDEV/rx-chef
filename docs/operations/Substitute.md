# Substitute

## Overview

A substitution cipher allowing you to specify bytes to replace with other byte values. This can be used to create Caesar ciphers but is more powerful as any byte value can be substituted, not just letters, and the substitution values need not be in order.<br><br>Enter the bytes you want to replace in the Plaintext field and the bytes to replace them with in the Ciphertext field.<br><br>Non-printable bytes can be specified using string escape notation. For example, a line feed character can be written as either <code>\n</code> or <code>\x0a</code>.<br><br>Byte ranges can be specified using a hyphen. For example, the sequence <code>0123456789</code> can be written as <code>0-9</code>.<br><br>Note that blackslash characters are used to escape special characters, so will need to be escaped themselves if you want to use them on their own (e.g.<code>\\</code>).

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | available |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Plaintext | `String` | no | `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` | — | no | The bytes you want to replace |
| 2 | Ciphertext | `String` | no | `XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW` | — | no | The bytes to replace them with |
| 3 | Ignore case | `Boolean` | no | `false` | — | no | If true, the case of the input character is preserved. |

## How it works

The shared execution engine validates the ordered arguments, passes the declared input representation to this operation, and validates the declared output contract. See the overview for the operation-specific format or algorithm.

## Implementation

Source module: `src/operations/substitute.rs`. Execution uses `rxchef::execute`; CLI, recipes, and the stdio server do not carry separate operation logic.

## Examples

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef run "Substitute"
```

For file or binary input use `rxchef run "Substitute" --input-file INPUT --output-file OUTPUT`.

## Pipeline usage

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef pipe "Substitute" to_base64
```

## Error conditions

Invalid input representations, invalid argument values, unavailable feature backends, and operation-specific processing failures return an error and a non-zero CLI status. Exact limitations are listed below when known.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` means compatibility has not been independently verified and must not be read as an exact-match claim.

## Security considerations

Side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and use execution limits for large data. Sensitive arguments are redacted by metadata-aware History output.

## Testing

The mapped Rust test and available KAT/differential/property/fuzz evidence are recorded in the [operation quality matrix](../reference/operation-matrix.md).

## Performance

See [benchmark results](../performance/results.md). Operations outside the representative catalog are explicitly marked with a skip rationale in the machine-readable quality inventory. Measurements are hardware-dependent reference values, not guarantees.

## Limitations

No verified limitation metadata is currently recorded; this is not a claim of perfect upstream parity.
