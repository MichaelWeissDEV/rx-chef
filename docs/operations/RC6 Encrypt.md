# RC6 Encrypt

## Overview

RC6 is a symmetric key block cipher derived from RC5. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin to meet the requirements of the AES competition, and was one of the five finalists.<br><br>RC6 is parameterised as RC6-w/r/b where w is word size in bits (any multiple of 8 from 8-256), r is the number of rounds (1-255), and b is the key length in bytes. The standard AES submission uses w=32, r=20. Common word sizes: 8, 16, 32 (standard), 64, 128.<br><br><b>IV:</b> The Initialisation Vector should be 4*w/8 bytes (e.g. 16 bytes for w=32). If not entered, it will default to null bytes.<br><br><b>Padding:</b> In CBC and ECB mode, the PKCS#7 padding scheme is used.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | Available |
| Input requirement | `Required` |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[Random]` |
| Deterministic | false |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Key | `Bytes` | yes | `<empty>` | — | yes | Key |
| 2 | IV | `Bytes` | no | `<empty>` | — | no | IV |
| 3 | Mode | `String` | no | `CBC` | — | no | Mode |
| 4 | Input | `String` | no | `Raw` | — | no | Input format |
| 5 | Output | `String` | no | `Hex` | — | no | Output format |
| 6 | Padding | `String` | no | `PKCS5` | — | no | Padding scheme |
| 7 | Word Size | `UnsignedInteger` | no | `32` | — | no | Word size in bits (8-256) |
| 8 | Rounds | `UnsignedInteger` | no | `20` | — | no | Number of rounds (1-255) |

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/rc6_encrypt.rs` and declares `String` input and `String` output. The operation module owns conversion and domain-error rules; registry resolution, argument validation, input-requirement enforcement, tracing, and output validation are performed by `rxchef::execution`.

## Command-line use

This operation requires input. Supply literal UTF-8 with `--input`, exact bytes with `--input-file`, or pipe bytes on stdin.

```console
rxchef run "RC6 Encrypt" --input-file input.bin --output-file output.bin
```

Arguments may be supplied positionally in the table order or by name with repeatable `--arg NAME=VALUE`. Omitted optional arguments use the documented defaults.

## Pipeline use

Place the operation anywhere a `String` value is valid. Its `String` result becomes the next step's input. Compact syntax uses the operation name followed by comma-separated arguments; JSON/YAML recipes use an `op` field and an `args` array.

## Error conditions

Schema violations are rejected before the operation runs. Malformed input, unsupported parameter combinations, unavailable optional backends, and domain processing failures produce structured errors and a non-zero CLI status; partial output is never reported as success.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` records an unassessed compatibility claim; it does not imply equality or incompatibility.

## Security considerations

Declared side effects: `[Random]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and apply execution limits to large data. Arguments marked sensitive in the schema are redacted from metadata-aware History displays.

## Testing evidence

Correctness tests:
- tests/tests/operations/rc6_encrypt.rs

## Performance classification

Excluded from the committed representative benchmark set: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.
