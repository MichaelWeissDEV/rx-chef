# PHP Deserialize

## Overview

Deserializes PHP serialized data, outputting keyed arrays as JSON.<br><br>This function does not support <code>object</code> tags.<br><br>Example:<br><code>a:2:{s:1:&quot;a&quot;;i:10;i:0;a:1:{s:2:&quot;ab&quot;;b:1;}}</code><br>becomes<br><code>{&quot;a&quot;: 10,0: {&quot;ab&quot;: true}}</code><br><br><u>Output valid JSON:</u> JSON doesn't support integers as keys, whereas PHP serialization does. Enabling this will cast these integers to strings. This will also escape backslashes.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | Available |
| Input requirement | `Required` |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Output valid JSON | `Boolean` | no | `true` | — | no | JSON doesn't support integers as keys, whereas PHP serialization does. Enabling this will cast these integers to strings. This will also escape backslashes. |

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/php_deserialize.rs` and declares `String` input and `String` output. The operation module owns conversion and domain-error rules; registry resolution, argument validation, input-requirement enforcement, tracing, and output validation are performed by `rxchef::execution`.

## Command-line use

This operation requires input. Supply literal UTF-8 with `--input`, exact bytes with `--input-file`, or pipe bytes on stdin.

```console
rxchef run "PHP Deserialize" --input-file input.bin --output-file output.bin
```

Arguments may be supplied positionally in the table order or by name with repeatable `--arg NAME=VALUE`. Omitted optional arguments use the documented defaults.

## Pipeline use

Place the operation anywhere a `String` value is valid. Its `String` result becomes the next step's input. Compact syntax uses the operation name followed by comma-separated arguments; JSON/YAML recipes use an `op` field and an `args` array.

## Error conditions

Schema violations are rejected before the operation runs. Malformed input, unsupported parameter combinations, unavailable optional backends, and domain processing failures produce structured errors and a non-zero CLI status; partial output is never reported as success.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` records an unassessed compatibility claim; it does not imply equality or incompatibility.

## Security considerations

Declared side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and apply execution limits to large data. Arguments marked sensitive in the schema are redacted from metadata-aware History displays.

## Performance classification

Excluded from the committed representative benchmark set: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.
