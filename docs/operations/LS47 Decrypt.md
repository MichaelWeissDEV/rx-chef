# LS47 Decrypt

## Overview

This is a slight improvement of the ElsieFour cipher as described by Alan Kaminsky. We use 7x7 characters instead of original (barely fitting) 6x6, to be able to encrypt some structured information. We also describe a simple key-expansion algorithm, because remembering passwords is popular. Similar security considerations as with ElsieFour hold.<br>The LS47 alphabet consists of following characters: <code>_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.0123456789,-+*/:?!'()</code><br>An LS47 key is a permutation of the alphabet that is then represented in a 7x7 grid used for the encryption or decryption.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | Available |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Password | `Bytes` | yes | `<empty>` | — | yes | The password used to derive the LS47 key |
| 2 | Padding | `Integer` | no | `10` | — | no | The number of padding characters to remove from the start of the output |

## How it works

This is a slight improvement of the ElsieFour cipher as described by Alan Kaminsky. We use 7x7 characters instead of original (barely fitting) 6x6, to be able to encrypt some structured information. We also describe a simple key-expansion algorithm, because remembering passwords is popular. Similar security considerations as with ElsieFour hold.<br>The LS47 alphabet consists of following characters: <code>_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.0123456789,-+*/:?!'()</code><br>An LS47 key is a permutation of the alphabet that is then represented in a 7x7 grid used for the encryption or decryption.

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/ls47_decrypt.rs` and declares `String` input and `String` output. Its operation module owns the conversion and error rules; every public frontend invokes it through `rxchef::execution`.

## Examples

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef run "LS47 Decrypt"
```

For file or binary input use `rxchef run "LS47 Decrypt" --input-file INPUT --output-file OUTPUT`.

## Pipeline usage

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef pipe "LS47 Decrypt" to_base64
```

## Error conditions

Invalid input representations, invalid argument values, unavailable feature backends, and operation-specific processing failures return an error and a non-zero CLI status. Exact limitations are listed below when known.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` means compatibility has not been independently verified and must not be read as an exact-match claim.

## Security considerations

Side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and use execution limits for large data. Sensitive arguments are redacted by metadata-aware History output.

## Testing

Correctness:
- tests/tests/operations/ls47_decrypt.rs

Known-answer:
- none recorded

Differential:
- none recorded

Property:
- none recorded

Fuzz:
- none recorded

## Performance

Not measured. Reason: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.

## Limitations

No verified limitation metadata is currently recorded; this is not a claim of perfect upstream parity.
