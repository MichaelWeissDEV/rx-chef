# Generate TOTP

## Overview

The Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time. It has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238, is the cornerstone of Initiative For Open Authentication (OAUTH), and is used in a number of two-factor authentication systems. A TOTP is an HOTP where the counter is the current time.

Enter the secret as the input or leave it blank for a random secret to be generated. T0 and T1 are in seconds.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | Available |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `Bytes`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Name | `String` | no | `<empty>` | — | no | The name of the account |
| 2 | Code length | `UnsignedInteger` | no | `6` | — | no | The number of digits in the generated code |
| 3 | Epoch offset (T0) | `Integer` | no | `0` | — | no | The epoch offset in seconds |
| 4 | Interval (T1) | `Integer` | no | `30` | — | no | The time interval in seconds |

## How it works

The Time-based One-Time Password algorithm (TOTP) is an algorithm that computes a one-time password from a shared secret key and the current time. It has been adopted as Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238, is the cornerstone of Initiative For Open Authentication (OAUTH), and is used in a number of two-factor authentication systems. A TOTP is an HOTP where the counter is the current time.

Enter the secret as the input or leave it blank for a random secret to be generated. T0 and T1 are in seconds.

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/generate_totp.rs` and declares `Bytes` input and `String` output. Its operation module owns the conversion and error rules; every public frontend invokes it through `rxchef::execution`.

## Examples

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef run "Generate TOTP"
```

For file or binary input use `rxchef run "Generate TOTP" --input-file INPUT --output-file OUTPUT`.

## Pipeline usage

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef pipe "Generate TOTP" to_base64
```

## Error conditions

Invalid input representations, invalid argument values, unavailable feature backends, and operation-specific processing failures return an error and a non-zero CLI status. Exact limitations are listed below when known.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` means compatibility has not been independently verified and must not be read as an exact-match claim.

## Security considerations

Side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and use execution limits for large data. Sensitive arguments are redacted by metadata-aware History output.

## Testing

Correctness:
- tests/tests/operations/generate_totp.rs

Known-answer:
- none recorded

Differential:
- none recorded

Property:
- none recorded

Fuzz:
- none recorded

## Performance

Not measured. Reason: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.

## Limitations

No verified limitation metadata is currently recorded; this is not a claim of perfect upstream parity.
