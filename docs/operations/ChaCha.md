# ChaCha

## Overview

ChaCha is a stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein. It is a variant of the Salsa stream cipher. Several parameterizations exist; 'ChaCha' may refer to the original construction, or to the variant as described in RFC-8439. ChaCha is often used with Poly1305, in the ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD construction.<br><br><b>Key:</b> ChaCha uses a key of 16 or 32 bytes (128 or 256 bits).<br><br><b>Nonce:</b> ChaCha uses a nonce of 8 or 12 bytes (64 or 96 bits).<br><br><b>Counter:</b> ChaCha uses a counter of 4 or 8 bytes (32 or 64 bits); together, the nonce and counter must add up to 16 bytes. The counter starts at zero at the start of the keystream, and is incremented at every 64 bytes.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Unknown` |
| Availability | Available |
| Input requirement | `Required` |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Key | `Bytes` | yes | `<empty>` | — | yes | The encryption key (16 or 32 bytes) |
| 2 | Nonce | `Bytes` | no | `<empty>` | — | no | The nonce (8 or 12 bytes) |
| 3 | Counter | `UnsignedInteger` | no | `0` | — | no | Initial counter value |
| 4 | Rounds | `Enum` | no | `20` | 20, 12, 8 | no | Number of rounds (20, 12, or 8) |
| 5 | Input | `String` | no | `Hex` | — | no | Format of input data |
| 6 | Output | `String` | no | `Raw` | — | no | Format of output data |

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/chacha.rs` and declares `String` input and `String` output. The operation module owns conversion and domain-error rules; registry resolution, argument validation, input-requirement enforcement, tracing, and output validation are performed by `rxchef::execution`.

## Command-line use

This operation requires input. Supply literal UTF-8 with `--input`, exact bytes with `--input-file`, or pipe bytes on stdin.

```console
rxchef run "ChaCha" --input-file input.bin --output-file output.bin
```

Arguments may be supplied positionally in the table order or by name with repeatable `--arg NAME=VALUE`. Omitted optional arguments use the documented defaults.

## Pipeline use

Place the operation anywhere a `String` value is valid. Its `String` result becomes the next step's input. Compact syntax uses the operation name followed by comma-separated arguments; JSON/YAML recipes use an `op` field and an `args` array.

## Error conditions

Schema violations are rejected before the operation runs. Malformed input, unsupported parameter combinations, unavailable optional backends, and domain processing failures produce structured errors and a non-zero CLI status; partial output is never reported as success.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` records an unassessed compatibility claim; it does not imply equality or incompatibility.

## Security considerations

Declared side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and apply execution limits to large data. Arguments marked sensitive in the schema are redacted from metadata-aware History displays.

## Performance classification

Excluded from the committed representative benchmark set: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.
