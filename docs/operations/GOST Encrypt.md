# GOST Encrypt

## Overview

The GOST block cipher (Magma), defined in the standard GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830), is a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. The original standard, published in 1989, did not give the cipher any name, but the most recent revision of the standard, GOST R 34.12-2015 (RFC 7801, RFC 8891), specifies that it may be referred to as Magma. The GOST hash function is based on this cipher. The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called Kuznyechik.

| 2 | IV | `Bytes` | no | `<empty>` | — | no | The initialization vector. |
| 3 | Input type | `Enum` | no | `Raw` | Raw, Hex | no | Input encoding (Raw, Hex) |
| 4 | Output type | `Enum` | no | `Hex` | Hex, Raw | no | Output encoding (Hex, Raw) |
| 5 | Algorithm | `String` | no | `GOST 28147 (1989)` | — | no | The GOST algorithm to use. |
| 6 | sBox | `String` | no | `E-TEST` | — | no | The sBox to use (only for GOST 28147 (1989)). |
| 7 | Block mode | `String` | no | `ECB` | — | no | The block cipher mode to use. |
| 8 | Key meshing mode | `String` | no | `NO` | — | no | The key meshing mode to use. |

## How it works

The GOST block cipher (Magma), defined in the standard GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830), is a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 64 bits. The original standard, published in 1989, did not give the cipher any name, but the most recent revision of the standard, GOST R 34.12-2015 (RFC 7801, RFC 8891), specifies that it may be referred to as Magma. The GOST hash function is based on this cipher. The new standard also specifies a new 128-bit block cipher called Kuznyechik.

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/gost_encrypt.rs` and declares `Bytes` input and `Bytes` output. Its operation module owns the conversion and error rules; every public frontend invokes it through `rxchef::execution`.

## Examples

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef run "GOST Encrypt"
```

For file or binary input use `rxchef run "GOST Encrypt" --input-file INPUT --output-file OUTPUT`.

## Pipeline usage

```console
printf 'input' | rxchef pipe "GOST Encrypt" to_base64
```

## Error conditions

Invalid input representations, invalid argument values, unavailable feature backends, and operation-specific processing failures return an error and a non-zero CLI status. Exact limitations are listed below when known.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Unknown`. `Unknown` means compatibility has not been independently verified and must not be read as an exact-match claim.

## Security considerations

Side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and use execution limits for large data. Sensitive arguments are redacted by metadata-aware History output.

## Testing

Correctness:
- tests/tests/operations/gost_encrypt.rs

Known-answer:
- none recorded

Differential:
- none recorded

Property:
- none recorded

Fuzz:
- none recorded

## Performance

Not measured. Reason: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.

## Limitations

No verified limitation metadata is currently recorded; this is not a claim of perfect upstream parity.
