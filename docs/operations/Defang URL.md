# Defang URL

## Overview

Takes a Universal Resource Locator (URL) and 'Defangs' it; meaning the URL becomes invalid, neutralising the risk of accidentally clicking on a malicious link.

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Exact` |
| Availability | Available |
| Input requirement | `Required` |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `String`.

## Output

Declared output type: `String`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Escape dots | `Boolean` | no | `true` | — | no | Escape dots in the URL |
| 2 | Escape http | `Boolean` | no | `true` | — | no | Escape http/https in the URL |
| 3 | Escape :// | `Boolean` | no | `true` | — | no | Escape :// in the URL |
| 4 | Process | `String` | no | `Valid domains and full URLs` | — | no | Process option |

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/defang_url.rs` and declares `String` input and `String` output. The operation module owns conversion and domain-error rules; registry resolution, argument validation, input-requirement enforcement, tracing, and output validation are performed by `rxchef::execution`.

## Command-line use

This operation requires input. Supply literal UTF-8 with `--input`, exact bytes with `--input-file`, or pipe bytes on stdin.

```console
rxchef run "Defang URL" --input-file input.bin --output-file output.bin
```

Arguments may be supplied positionally in the table order or by name with repeatable `--arg NAME=VALUE`. Omitted optional arguments use the documented defaults.

## Pipeline use

Place the operation anywhere a `String` value is valid. Its `String` result becomes the next step's input. Compact syntax uses the operation name followed by comma-separated arguments; JSON/YAML recipes use an `op` field and an `args` array.

## Error conditions

Schema violations are rejected before the operation runs. Malformed input, unsupported parameter combinations, unavailable optional backends, and domain processing failures produce structured errors and a non-zero CLI status; partial output is never reported as success.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Exact`. `Unknown` records an unassessed compatibility claim; it does not imply equality or incompatibility.

## Security considerations

Declared side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and apply execution limits to large data. Arguments marked sensitive in the schema are redacted from metadata-aware History displays.

## Testing evidence

## Performance classification

Excluded from the committed representative benchmark set: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.
