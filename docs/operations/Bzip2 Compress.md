# Bzip2 Compress

## Overview

Bzip2 is a compression library developed by Julian Seward (of GHC fame) that uses the Burrows-Wheeler algorithm. It only supports compressing single files and its compression is slow, however is more effective than Deflate (.gz & .zip).

## Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Implementation | `Partial` |
| Parity | `Exact` |
| Availability | Available |
| Input requirement | `Required` |
| Features | none |
| Side effects | `[]` |
| Deterministic | true |

## Input

Declared input type: `Bytes`.

## Output

Declared output type: `Bytes`. Redirect stdout or use `--output-file` for exact binary bytes.

## Arguments

| # | Argument | Type | Required | Default | Allowed | Sensitive | Description |
|---:|---|---|:---:|---|---|:---:|---|
| 1 | Block size (100s of kb) | `UnsignedInteger` | no | `9` | — | no | Block size for compression (1-9) |
| 2 | Work factor | `Integer` | no | `30` | — | no | Effort spent on difficult data (0-250, 30 is default) |

## Implementation

The implementation is in `src/operations/bzip2_compress.rs` and declares `Bytes` input and `Bytes` output. The operation module owns conversion and domain-error rules; registry resolution, argument validation, input-requirement enforcement, tracing, and output validation are performed by `rxchef::execution`.

## Command-line use

This operation requires input. Supply literal UTF-8 with `--input`, exact bytes with `--input-file`, or pipe bytes on stdin.

```console
rxchef run "Bzip2 Compress" --input-file input.bin --output-file output.bin
```

Arguments may be supplied positionally in the table order or by name with repeatable `--arg NAME=VALUE`. Omitted optional arguments use the documented defaults.

## Pipeline use

Place the operation anywhere a `Bytes` value is valid. Its `Bytes` result becomes the next step's input. Compact syntax uses the operation name followed by comma-separated arguments; JSON/YAML recipes use an `op` field and an `args` array.

## Error conditions

Schema violations are rejected before the operation runs. Malformed input, unsupported parameter combinations, unavailable optional backends, and domain processing failures produce structured errors and a non-zero CLI status; partial output is never reported as success.

## CyberChef compatibility

Parity status: `Exact`. `Unknown` records an unassessed compatibility claim; it does not imply equality or incompatibility.

## Security considerations

Declared side effects: `[]`. Treat parser inputs as untrusted and apply execution limits to large data. Arguments marked sensitive in the schema are redacted from metadata-aware History displays.

## Testing evidence

Correctness tests:

Differential tests:

## Performance classification

Excluded from the committed representative benchmark set: No stable representative benchmark case is defined; operation remains Partial until performance evidence is reviewed.
